"""Feature flags through OpenFeature.

The Vrixel SDLC tool gives each feature a flag (a key like `emr.emr-feat-3.referral-triage`) in
the product's Flipt when its design is approved: on in dev and staging, off in production until
the feature is released. Put the feature's new behavior behind it:

    from mcp_server import flags

    if flags.enabled("emr.emr-feat-3.referral-triage", user=caller):
        ...  # the new behavior (e.g. a new field, or a new tool that answers)
    else:
        ...  # today's behavior (a new tool says it isn't available yet)

Flags are read from the product's Flipt over OFREP (the OpenFeature Remote Evaluation
Protocol). With no flag server configured every flag reads as its default, so a new feature stays
off. Tests can swap in an in-memory provider with `use_provider`.
